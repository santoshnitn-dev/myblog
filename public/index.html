	Refer blogs for v1 and v2 for more history about this
And here&rsquo;s a reminder on how important it is to document: https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/
Dev journal v2 has done a pretty good job for me. I recently also added a functionality on my windows laptop to sync it up to a cloud storage (onedrive) via a windows automation scheduler called &ldquo;Task Scheduler&rdquo; at regular intervals of the day. I gotta say it&rsquo;s pretty neat feature which I didn&rsquo;t know about.&hellip;

	I was trying to solve this leetcode problem and had to refer the solutions after some minutes attempting it. Then came across this super simple ingenious solution. Took a lot of time trying to wrap my head around it. So I thought I&rsquo;d just share my thought process was like trying to digest this super simple looking yet miraculous code:
Max consecutive ones iii Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii
Note: you&rsquo;ll need basic understanding of what this problem is asking for and may a preliminary very high level overview of the code flow&hellip;

⚠️Disclaimer: These are just words cooked up from my head and not definitive or exact. More like recalling stories from personal experience. The details I&rsquo;ll leave it to you and google or CA.
1) Reporting your mid FY job change TL;DR report your previous employer as soon as you join new company&hellip;

	Since the first blog on a dev journal here, I&rsquo;ve made some changes.
With the onset of LLMs I&rsquo;ve gotten help from chatGPT to upgrade my dev journal workflow.
Some things that have not changed are the log markdown file(daily_log.md) where your logs go into and the alias names.
Things that have changed:
1) Shell script Instead of having a cron job update the daily dates and month headers on a set time, which can and will fail to run if your machine is not ON at the time of cron schedule.&hellip;

	I end up having to lookup certain words which I&rsquo;m not familiar with often and even though spotlight(macOS) provides quick lookup sometimes it mixes up with other files or OS related applications.
So if you are someone who finds yourself in the terminal most of your days this will be helpful.
What you&rsquo;ll need Terminal curl CLI tool (which is inbuilt in most cases) jq CLI command (google &ldquo;how to install jq in your_os) That&rsquo;s it!&hellip;

	If you read tech blogs you’ll come across articles stating how important how important it is to maintain a dev journal or bragging doc or what have you. Basically it’s just a doc where you track all that you have done, read, watched, etc.
Your brain being a finite resource can only hold so much information. Over time you lose track of the code change you made, the valuable life advice you gave to that junior, some quote someone said over a meeting.&hellip;

	I&rsquo;ve owned the AirPod Pros for a little over a year and the Nothing ear(1) for about 2 weeks as of this writing. Below I share some personal experiences and opinions which may help in deciding if caught in a dillema between the two amazing products.
Official product links:
AirPods Pro Nothing ear(1) Let&rsquo;s get started&hellip;
Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) This is a close one at least in my ears. They both keep out noise pretty well.&hellip;

	Dotfiles are used to customize your system. The “dotfiles” name is derived from the configuration files in Unix-like systems that start with a dot (e.g. .bash_profile and .gitconfig). In this post I will share some of my most used configurations for some common dotfiles.
.zshrc greph () { fc -ln 0 | grep --color=auto $1 | awk &#39;!seen[$0]++&#39; | sed -e &#39;s/^/&gt;&gt; /&#39; } I love this one. Probably my favorite in this dotfile.&hellip;

	jq command A command to manipulate json files. At work we usually have a bunch json serialized ouputs in S3 or some other datastore, which are absurdly many lines long and deeply nested. Often, if I need to grep something out of it, I&rsquo;ll just copy and paste it to a company internal json prettifier to make it human readable and get what I need. There must be some out on the web too.&hellip;
